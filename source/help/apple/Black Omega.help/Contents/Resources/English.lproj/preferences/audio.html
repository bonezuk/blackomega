			<p>Audio Preferences is located in the <a href="./pref.html" bookID="uk.co.blackomega.blackomega">Preferences</a> dialog in the Audio tab.</p>

		<div id="sound_device" class="instructions">
			<p>The Sound Device drop-down lists your available sound cards and external DAC hardware. 
			Select the Sound Device, from the list, you wish Black Omega to use.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>Black Omega supports multi-channel speaker configurations such as 7.1 or 5.1 sound cards and AVR amplifiers. Dependent upon the number of 
			output channels the Audio Preferences allow you to select the speaker configuration that matches the selected Sound Device. Note that for some 
			devices (e.g. AVR amplifiers via HDMI) require <a href="../integer.html">Exclusive Mode</a> to be selected to access all the speakers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="instructions">
			<p>If the selected Sound Device can support <a href="../integer.html" bookID="uk.co.blackomega.blackomega">Exclusive Mode</a>, for improved audio playback, it can be turned on via the associated checkbox.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="speaker_config" class="instructions">
			<p>Use the Speaker Configuration drop-down list to select the number of speaker outputs you have and hence 
			their associated setup. The number of speakers available will also be dependent on the number of output 
			channels supported by your sound device.</p>
			<p>Depending on your chosen Speaker Configuration the associated surround sound speaker configuration will be enabled.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="stereo_config" class="instructions">
			<p>Black Omega can extend your stereo sound stage by playing a stereo track through multiple speakers. The Stereo Configuration group of 
			options provides control of what speakers to utilise in stereo playback. The Speakers L/R drop-down list allows you to choose which pair(s) of stereo 
			speakers to play through.</p>
			<p>If available, a Center channel can be generated from the Left and Right channels to be played through a dedicated Center speaker.</p>
			<p>If available, a Low Frequency Effect (LFE) channel can be generated for playback through a dedicated Subwoofer speaker. Black Omega employs a 
			FIR low bandpass filter creating a proper LFE channel for your attached Subwoofer.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="output_channels" class="instructions">
			<p>Under each of the enabled speakers there is drop-down box with a list of numbers. Each number corresponds to a 
			specific output channel from your sound device. For each speaker, set the output channel number such that it 
			physically corresponds to that speaker.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="test_channels" class="instructions">
			<p>You can test to see if a particular speaker has been assigned to the right output channel. As you move the mouse 
			pointer over an active speaker icon on the Audio Preference interface a playback button will become visible on top of 
			the speaker. Left click this and an audio sample stating the name of the speaker will be played through the assigned 
			channel.</p>
			<p>If you move your mouse over the blue person located in the middle of the speakers a playback button will also appear. 
			Left clicking this will play an appropriate sample through each of the active speakers.</p>
			<p>As a speaker's test sample is played you can see which sample is being played by looking at the playback control interface.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>As an example, the configuration shown above is for a sound card with a full 7.1 surround-sound setup.</p>
			<p>The output channels are mapped to the following speakers</p>
		</div>
		<table>
			<tr class="heading"><td>Output Channel</td><td>Speaker</td></tr>
			<tr><td>0</td><td>Front Left</td></tr>
			<tr><td>1</td><td>Front Right</td></tr>
			<tr><td>3</td><td>Center</td></tr>

			<tr><td>5</td><td>Rear Right</td></tr>
			<tr><td>6</td><td>Surround Left</td></tr>
			<tr><td>7</td><td>Surround Right</td></tr>
		</table>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>From the example above, where Stereo Configuration has been set to “Front + Surround + Rear” then</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The left channel will be played simultaneously through the Front Left, Surround Left and Rear Left speakers.</li>
				<li>The right channel will be played simultaneously through the Front Right, Surround Right and Rear Right speakers.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In addition, a Center and a LFE channel will be mixed and played back on their respective speakers.</p>
